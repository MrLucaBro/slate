# Introduction

Welcome to the RAYPACK AI Platform. Our platform is a fully integrated solution enabling users to deploy and develop AI models. We offer ready-to-deploy as well as custom models to improve the efficiency of your business with AI. All our models are deployable as a service on our platform or can be conveniently embedded into existing systems on-premise. You can use our API to run AI models and receive their output as an image (.jpg) or as a JSON file. The main language used to access our API is Shell, but you can customize the code examples to any language you prefer. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.



# Authentication

> To authorize, use your API-key in the blank space after 'apikey='in every request you send:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct parameter with each request.
curl -X POST -F "apikey= " ...
```


Our platform uses API-keys to allow access to the API. You can register for a trial key at our [homepage](http://raypack.ai).

The server expects the API-key to be included in all API requests as a parameter, that looks like the following example:

-F "apikey:****"

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>****</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# RAYPACK AI Models
> The call below requests a list of available models and returns it as a JSON:

```shell
curl -X POST -F 'apikey= ' 'https://api.raypack.ai/getmodels'
```

The RAYPACK AI platform offers a number of ready-to-deploy models.
These models are:

1. RAYPACK Multi-object Detection
2. RAYPACK Food Detection
3. RAYPACK Celebrity Detection US
4. RAYPACK Face AI / RAYPACK Face AI v4
5. RAYPACK Demographics Detection
6. RAYPACK Fashion Detection

You can connect with the RAYPACK Platform API by sending http requests to our API server `https://api.raypack.ai`.
You can get an overview over all available models by sending the http request on the right to the endpoint `https://api.raypack.ai/getmodels`. The models themselves are available under the endpoint `https://api.raypack.ai/recog`. In this section, we will give detailed examples of how you can use each of our ready-to-deploy models.

The RAYPACK Color Model analyses the colors that make up an image and returns a hexadecimal value, name and percentage for each. When combined with other models, such as RAYPACK Fashion Detection, it is able to generate insights about the color of detected objects and increases the flexibility and value of your inference.

--------- | ------- | -----------
threshold | - | Sets the threshold of detection confidence required to return an object as detected.

# RAYPACK Vector-based Embedding

In addition to our ready-to-deploy models we offer vector-based encoding of images to facililate your database operations.
Our models encode images into vectors increasing the speed with which image matching and other operations can be accomplished.
Currently two versions are available:

1. 512 Vector Embedding
2. 2048 Vector Embedding

## RAYPACK 512 Vector Embedding

> The call below requests the vectorization of the image given in file and returns a JSON.  
Here is an example:  

```shell
curl -X POST -F "apikey= " -F "threshold=0.4"
-F "file=fashion.jpg"
-F "model=7" -F "lang=de" "https://api.raypack.ai/recog"

```

> The above call returns JSON structured containing the 512 element vector
representation produced by the model.

```json
{
  "name":"Raypack_AI_Filecontainer",
  "version":"1.0",
  "license":"commercial",
  "results":
  {
    "stats":
    {
      "modelname":"RaypackVector",
      "modelid":"7",
      "originalfile":"fashion.jpg",
      "starttime":1546872010419,
      "endtime":1546872010656,
      "duration":0.237
    },
    "vector":
    [
      0.782311201095581, ...
    ]
  }
}

```
The RAYPACK 512 Vector Embedding returns a vector representation of a given image that can be stored in databases. It reduces the memory space needed to store the images and facilitates operations such as image comparisons. The 512 Vector embedding trades off some detail in the representation for less memory usage compared to the more detailed 2048 Vector Embedding model. However, even a less detailed representations enable highly accurate and fast performance.

## RAYPACK 2048 Vector Embedding

> The call below requests the vectorization of the image given in file and returns a JSON.  
The process is very similar to the 512 Vector Embedding:  

```shell
curl -X POST -F "apikey= " -F "threshold=0.4"
-F "file=fashion.jpg"
-F "model=8" -F "lang=de" "https://api.raypack.ai/recog"

```
> The above call returns JSON structured containing the 2048 element vector
representation produced by the model.

```json
{
  "name":"Raypack_AI_Filecontainer",
  "version":"1.0",
  "license":"commercial",
  "results":
  {
    "stats":
    {
      "modelname":"RaypackVector",
      "modelid":"8",
      "originalfile":"fashion.jpg",
      "starttime":1546872690402,
      "endtime":1546872691363,
      "duration":0.961
    },
    "vector":
    [
      0.24560748040676117, ...
    ]
  }
}

```
The RAYPACK 2048 Vector Embedding returns a more detailed representation of the given image, compared to the 512 Vector Embedding. It enables highly accurate and fast image operations, while still reducing used memory space. This is especially interesting in area of face recognition and identification in large databases.
