# Introduction

Welcome to the RAYPACK AI Platform. Our platform is a fully integrated solution enabling users to deploy and develop AI models. We offer ready-to-deploy as well as custom models to improve the efficiency of your business with AI. All our models are deployable as a service on our platform or can be conveniently embedded into existing systems on-premise. You can use our API to run AI models and receive their output as an image (.jpg) or as a JSON file. The main language used to access our API is Shell, but you can customize the code examples to any language you prefer. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.



# Authentication

> To authorize, use your API-key in the blank space after 'apikey='in every request you send:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct parameter with each request.
curl -X POST -F "apikey=****" ...
```


Our platform uses API-keys to allow access to the API. You can register for a trial key at our [homepage](http://raypack.ai).

The server expects the API-key to be included in all API requests as a parameter, that looks like the following example:

-F "apikey:****"

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>****</code> with your personal API key.

The RAYPACK AI platform offers a number of ready-to-deploy models.
These models are:

1. RAYPACK Multi-Object Detection
2. RAYPACK Multi-Object Localization
3. RAYPACK Food Detection
4. RAYPACK Celebrity Detection US
5. RAYPACK Face AI
6. RAYPACK Face AI fast
7. RAYPACK Demographics Detection
8. RAYPACK Fashion Detection
9. RAYPACK Color Model

You can connect with the RAYPACK Platform API by sending http requests to our API server `https://api.raypack.ai`.
You can get an overview over all available models by sending the http request on the right to the endpoint `https://api.raypack.ai/getmodels`. The models themselves are available under the endpoint `https://api.raypack.ai/recog`. In this section, we will give detailed examples of how you can use each of our ready-to-deploy models.

lang | - | Language of the output. You can choose between English `lang=en` or German `lang=de`.
mode | - | Defines the form of returned output. The model can return JPEG images `mode=image`, JSON files `mode=json` or both `mode=jsonimage`.
facemode | - | Lets you determine the level of anonymization in the output. You can decide if you want the original image with a bounding box `facemode=default`, blurred faces `facemode=pixel`, faces replaced with rectangles `facemode=fill` or only core information on black background `facemode=black`.
facefinder | 3 | Lets you determine the level of upscaling of the image given to the model. The options are: No upscaling `facefinder=1`, upscaling by a factor of 0.5 `facefinder=1` and upscaling by the factors 2, 1 and 0.5 `facefinder=3` .
hex | - | Lets you determine the color of the bounding boxes drawn onto the output images. For example `hex=#FF0000` for red bounding boxes. You can enter the value in upper and lower cases and with or without the #.

# RAYPACK Vector-based Embedding

RAYPACK Vector Embedding employs one shot learning logic to rethink the way images are processed with neural networks. Instead of training a network on huge datasets for each  classification purpose we simply compare stored vector representations to each other.
This workflow makes retraining of the model obsolete, because new images can be simply added to the database in which the representations are stored.

Imagine you would want to create an AI model that recognizes sports stars in an vast archive of video material. With traditional models you would have to create large annotated datasets for each star and even retrain the model if you want to add an additional star. With RAYPACK Vector Embedding however you could simply create a database of vector representations and classify new images based on the difference between their representations and the ones stored in your database. This method greatly increases the efficiency of classifications, while still saving money and time. A typical workflow of detecting the identity of a sports star could look like so:

1. Extract the regions of the image containing faces with RAYPACK Face AI.
2. Convert these regions into vector representations using our RAYPACK Vector Embedding.
3. Compare the resulting representations with the representations stored in the database using our vector comparisons.
4. Use the results for your classification needs (i.e. Who is in the image?).

The workflow can be used for almost any classification purpose and is easily scalable. All the calls needed can be found in this documentation. You can use our existing object database or start building your own.

Currently two versions are available:

* 512 Vector Embedding
* 2048 Vector Embedding

## RAYPACK 512 Vector Embedding

Here is an example:  

```shell
curl -X POST -F "apikey=****" -F "threshold=0.4" \

-F "model=7" -F "lang=de" "https://api.raypack.ai/recog"

```

> The above call returns JSON structured containing the 512 element vector
representation produced by the model.

  }
}

```
The RAYPACK 512 Vector Embedding returns a vector representation of a given image that can be stored in databases. It reduces the memory space needed to store the images and facilitates operations such as image comparisons. The 512 Vector embedding trades off some detail in the representation for less memory usage compared to the more detailed 2048 Vector Embedding model. However, even a less detailed representations enable highly accurate and fast performance.

The RAYPACK 2048 Vector Embedding returns a more detailed representation of the given image, compared to the 512 Vector Embedding. It enables highly accurate and fast image operations, while still being more memory efficient than image storage. These aspects make 2048 vector encoding especially interesting for face recognition in large databases and archives.
