# Introduction

Welcome to the RAYPACK AI Platform. Our platform is a fully integrated solution enabling users to deploy and develop AI models. We offer ready-to-deploy as well as custom models to improve the efficiency of your business with AI. All our models are deployable as a service on our platform or can be conveniently embedded into existing systems on-premise. You can use our API to run AI models and receive their output as an image (.jpg) or as a JSON file. The main language used to access our API is Shell, but you can customize the code examples to any language you prefer. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.



# Authentication

> To authorize, use your API-key in the blank space after 'apikey='in every request you send:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request.
curl -X POST -F "apikey= " ...
```


Our platform uses API-keys to allow access to the API. You can register for a trial key at our [homepage](http://raypack.ai).

The server expects the API-key to be included in all API requests as a parameter, that looks like the following example:

-F "apikey:****"

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>****</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# RAYPACK AI models
> The call below requests a list of available models and returns it as a JSON:

```shell
curl -X POST -F 'apikey= ' 'https://api.raypack.ai/getmodels'
```

The RAYPACK AI platform offers a number of ready-to-deploy models.
These models are:

* Multi-object detection
* Food detection
* Face AI
* Celebrity Detection US
* Demographics Detection

You can connect with the RAYPACK Platform API by sending http requests to our API server `https://api.raypack.ai`.
You can get an overview over all available models by sending the http request on the right to the endpoint `https://api.raypack.ai/getmodels`. The models themselves are available under the endpoint `https://api.raypack.ai/recog`. In this section we will give detailed examples of how you could use each of our ready-to-deploy models.
